Task Burndown Application for Agile in Everyday LIfe

##Idea
Burndown charts are great ways to see how you are doing on tasks and allowing you to calculate how much work you can 
do in a period of time.

This app is yet another task app, this time incorporating the agile theory of point weight and burndown charts.

##Technology
This app will use django1.7rc3 as a backend and angular with angular-material-design as a frontend and frontend framework.
This should allow it to be desktop and mobile friendly out of the box, and allow for some power interactions.
